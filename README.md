# College Attendance API

This api will help and manage college student attendance. Faculty and student can register using this api and monitor all attendance related tasks.
This api is comfortable with swagger openAPI docs. So if you want to create an app or website for frontend and integrate this api to it, you can easily do that.

I already created a `React Native` frontend application, so you can also check out that.
